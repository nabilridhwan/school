# Rights of using these files
The purpose of these files is for the reader to refer to and compare with their work. Sometimes these files can be used as a second perspective. I am not responsible for what the reader does to the files, which includes but is not limited to cheating. Cheating is wrong!

# Naming of files.
Tutorials and practicals in this repository follow a particular naming convention which may look like these:
```
t1q1.js
p3q3.js
t5q1pa.js
```

There are two or three different sections to the file name. We will take `t5q1pa.js` as an example.

## Breaking down the sections
`t5q1pa` breaks down to `t5 q1 pa`

## The first section
The first section's letter denotes the assignment type. "t" stands for tutorial, "p" for practical and rarely, "a" for assignment. The number that comes after the letter is the assignment's number.

## The second section
The second section is the question number which will always be prefixed by the letter `q`.

## The third section
The third section is optional but states the attempted part and starts with the letter `p`. The character that follows after `p` is the part letter/number.

## Piecing and making sense of the sections
With all the knowledge, `t5q1pa` translates to the first question, part "a" in tutorial number 5.
