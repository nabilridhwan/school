All codes relating to my stay in Singapore Polytechnic.

## How can I view these codes?

You can open the in-browser GitHub VS Code-esque editor by replacing the `.com` in `github.com` in the URL bar with `.dev` making it `github.dev` OR by pressing on the `.` key on your keyboard.

A VS Code-esque editor will open up and you can view the files individually like how you'd do it in VS Code.

## Disclaimer!

The purpose of these files is for the reader to refer and compare with their work, to see what they have missed out or do code review against their own code. **I am not liable for your grades because you don't seem to use your brain.**

## Legacy naming scheme (For Year 1 modules)

### Naming of files

(Some, not all) tutorials and practicals in this repository follow a particular naming convention which may look like these:
`t1q1.js, p3q3.js or t5q1pa.js`

There are two or three different sections to the file name. We will take `t5q1pa.js` as an example.

### Breaking down the sections

`t5q1pa` breaks down to three sections: `t5 q1 pa`

#### The first section (`t5`)

The first section's letter denotes the assignment type. "t" stands for tutorial, "p" for practical and rarely, "a" for assignment. The number that comes after the letter is the assignment's number.

#### The second section (`q1`)

The second section is the question number which will always be prefixed by the letter `q`.

#### The third section (`p1`)

The third section is optional but states the attempted part and starts with the letter `p`. The character that follows after `p` is the part letter/number.

#### Piecing and making sense of the sections

With all the knowledge, `t5q1pa` is the first question, part "a" in tutorial number 5.
