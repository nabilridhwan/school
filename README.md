# Who and How can these files be used?
The purpose of these files is for the user to refer and compare with their work.

**I am not liable for your grades because you don't seem to use your brain.**

# Naming of files
(Some, not all) tutorials and practicals in this repository follow a particular naming convention which may look like these:
`
t1q1.js,
p3q3.js or
t5q1pa.js
`

There are two or three different sections to the file name. We will take `t5q1pa.js` as an example.

## Breaking down the sections
`t5q1pa` breaks down to three sections: `t5 q1 pa`

### The first section (`t5`)
The first section's letter denotes the assignment type. "t" stands for tutorial, "p" for practical and rarely, "a" for assignment. The number that comes after the letter is the assignment's number.

### The second section (`q1`)
The second section is the question number which will always be prefixed by the letter `q`.

### The third section (`p1`)
The third section is optional but states the attempted part and starts with the letter `p`. The character that follows after `p` is the part letter/number.

### Piecing and making sense of the sections
With all the knowledge, `t5q1pa` is the first question, part "a" in tutorial number 5.
